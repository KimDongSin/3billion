                        ‘The Good Doctors’ is a programmed series of interviews to meet doctors who face patients with
                        rare diseases every
                        day and hear their stories on site. These interviews were planned to help us provide better
                        insight for physicians by
                        recording how genetic testing for rare diseases is conducted, how it’s used at clinical sites,
                        and how it can be improved.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Our first guest is Doctor Geu Ru Hong from Severance Hospital. He has been with the Yonsei
                        University College of
                        Medicine as a professor of cardiology since 2012 and is currently leading the hypertrophic
                        cardiomyopathy and Fabry
                        disease clinic. Although he does not specialize in clinical genetics, he has been a pioneer in
                        adopting and employing the
                        most advanced diagnostic technologies.
                    </p>

                    <p class="p__color">* This article is based on the interview conducted at Yonsei Severance Hospital
                        on June 8.</p>

                        <p>
                            Hello, Professor. Thank you for agreeing to this interview and taking time out of your busy
                            schedule
                            (In fact, there were a lot of patients waiting to meet the professor on the day of the
                            interview).
                        </p>

                    <h1 class="font__h2">What type of a doctor do you consider yourself to be?</h1>

                            <h1>Genie</h1>

                            <p>
                                You have been active not only at the clinical sites but also by participating in several
                                broadcasts, academic
                                conferences, and interviews as an expert in cardiovascular diseases. What type of a
                                doctor
                                do you
                                consider yourself to be or what kind of doctor do you wish to become?

                            <h1>Dr. Hong</h1>

                            <p>
                                Since I was a child, I thought "A should be like B.” Students should be like students,
                                soldiers should be like
                                soldiers, politicians should be like politicians, and doctors should be like doctors.
                                So,
                                when I entered
                                medical school, I spent a lot of time thinking about what makes doctors who they are,
                                and I
                                then realized
                                that the heart is what makes people feel alive. Creating a healthy heart and treating
                                the
                                heart seemed like
                                the most doctor-like duty in that they can assist a person to continue living.
                                That is why I chose the department of cardiology.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <img src="../common/images/company/blog__main__two.png" alt="">
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        When you meet a lot of patients, you find out that the lifestyle and severity of symptoms in
                        patients vary greatly,
                        even if they suffer from the same disease. There are students busy with their studies,
                        housewives busy with children,
                        the elderly, and so on.
                    </p>

                    <p class="marginB">
                        Therefore, the same disease should not be treated in the same manner for all patients. I
                        believe suggesting the most
                        optimal treatment method and cycle best suited for each patient, considering their symptoms
                        and lifestyle, means
                        genuinely caring for a patient. Completely personalized treatment is not only about treating
                        the underlying causes of
                        symptoms but also about improving patients’ quality of life. It is essential to not solely
                        rely on traditional knowledge of
                        medicine but to keep searching and adopting new knowledge. It is not easy, but I am trying
                        to be that kind of a doctor.
